						Over the summer, in fact since May 18th, we’ve been able to get out and explore our beautiful country of Portugal. Personally, I’ve taken road trips in the Alentejo and Central Portugal regions, beach hopping at home in the Algarve, spent a month in Lisbon for a language course and two weeks in The Azores, so have a fairly good idea about how each part of the country feels like as a tourist. Throughout, I’ve felt safe, secure and that our nation has taken precautions and health and safety seriously. Now, most Portugal coronavirus restrictions have been lifted for some countries. <br>
						For sure, many of us in the world are in the same boat when it comes to lockdowns, to varying degrees and different stages, and have likely seen a lot of our plans for 2020 cancelled. If however, you are planning to travel to Portugal in 2020, I wanted to give some insight into life on the ground, the current rules, and what has been put in place to best control coronavirus in Portugal, particularly when travelling. <br>
						*Please note, this is a fast-moving situation and the information provided below is done so in good faith at the time of writing. There are various sources linked out to throughout the article, and particularly at the bottom, however, DanFlyingSolo takes no responsibility for the information provided here and urges you to check all official sources for updates. <br>
						For the most part, I have been impressed as a Portuguese resident at the coronavirus situation in Portugal, how it was managed initially, but also with the COVID-19 travel set up in Portugal. I’ve been on many trips in the last month, and (as far as I’m aware) have not had the virus, indeed both my tests have been negative, but I’m being wary and taking all the personal precautions I can, and will try to detail the real situation below. <br>
						While I was very supportive of the lockdown initially, I very much saw it as an opportunity to get the health system prepared, and Portugals coronavirus rules and precautions in place before reopening. I didn’t see it as a permanent solution, but preparation time. Tourism is a huge part of life here in Portugal, especially in some regional, seasonal destinations like the Algarve. <br>
						It’s easy to dismiss concerns of ‘the economy’ as huge businesses, stock-markets and corporate bailouts, but there are so many small, family-run businesses here reliant on tourism, and no income this summer, means no money to pay the bills in winter – this will of course lead to huge social issues and even in a relatively left-leaning, semi-socialist country, that will become a problem,
						As such, I support travel reopening, with the right restrictions in place, and if you are comfortable travelling right now, and can be respectful and take those precautions great – I fully understand it isn’t for everyone just now, but I don’t think we should be shaming everyone who is deciding to travel in the most responsible way they can either.
						Here is the current situation for Portugal travel restrictions, and how my recent trips in Portugal have gone down. You can also find a list of resources at the bottom of this page (in various languages) to keep updated, and I’ll aim to update this post weekly. <br>
